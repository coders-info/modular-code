# Modular Code

From #clean ideas to code #smells and #legacy code ... Let's talk about modularity in practice

## Code Expectations

+ everyone expect:
  + clean code
  + patterns
  + KISS
  + ...

## Code Reality

+ legacy code
+ spaghetti code
+ smells code
+ ...



## The Pragmatic Development

development => production of code to implement services based on requirements.

Environment:
+ management over production
+ requirements over expectations

Source-code:
+ reusability over creativity
+ writing over refactoring code

Data:
+ data standardization first
+ fat-data over fat-function
