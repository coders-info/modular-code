# Modular Code

From #clean ideas to code #smells and #legacy code ... Let's talk about modularity in practice

## Code Expectations

+ everyone expect:
  + clean code
  + patterns
  + KISS
  + ...

## Code Reality

+ legacy code
+ spaghetti code
+ smells code
+ ...



## The Pragmatic Development

development => production of code to implement services based on requirements.

Environment:
+ management over production
+ requirements over expectations

Source-code:
+ reusability over creativity
+ writing over refactoring code

Data:
+ data standardization first
+ fat-data over fat-function


## Hypermodularity

Hypermodularity refers to an advanced or extreme degree of modularity in the design and organization of systems, products, technologies, or processes. 
Modularity itself is a design principle that involves creating complex systems from smaller, manageable, interchangeable, and often standardized parts or modules.
The hypermodularity concept is taken to a higher level, where the modularity is exceptionally pronounced, allowing for even greater flexibility, customization, interchangeability, and scalability. 
 
Here are a few contexts where hypermodularity might be relevant:

+ **Technology and Computing**: In software development, a hypermodular architecture would allow for easier updates, maintenance, and scale, as individual modules or components can be modified or replaced without impacting the entire system.

+ **Manufacturing and Industry**: Hypermodular design in manufacturing processes or equipment can enable factories to quickly adapt to new product lines or changes in demand by reconfiguring modular components.

+ **Urban Design and Architecture**: Hypermodularity in urban design might involve the creation of living spaces or structures that can be quickly assembled, disassembled, and reassembled in different configurations depending on the changing needs of the inhabitants.

+ **Organizational Structures**: In management, a hypermodular organizational structure would reflect a highly flexible and adaptable model where teams or units can be formed, reformed, and disbanded as needed to respond to various projects and challenges.


Hypermodularity is often associated with terms like agility, resilience, and innovation, as it provides a framework for easily adapting to change and fostering continuous improvement. 

However, hypermodularity can also have drawbacks, such as potential issues with integration, increased complexity in coordination, or loss of optimization for specific functions due to the emphasis on general interchangeability.
